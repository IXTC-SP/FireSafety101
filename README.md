# FireSafety 101
Styles.css and index.html is fixed, but if need to re-build application:
1) Access project repo from IXTV Unity Account, project: ABE_FireSafety101, do edits as you wish.
2) Build application with WebGL in unity, with default template setting
3) Replace "Build" folder in github repo
4) Copy line 58-69 of newly build index.html and replace in repo's line 70 -81 index.html (to link index to the new build folder)
