Styles.css and index.html is fixed, but if need to re-build application:
1) Download repo 
2) Build application with WebGL in unity, with default template
3) Replace Build folder in repo
4) Copy line 69-80 of newly build index.html and replace in repo's line 70 -81 index.html (to link index to the new build folder)
